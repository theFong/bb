# Claude Code provider

Read settings with `bb plugin config provider-claude-code`; change a declared key
with `bb plugin config provider-claude-code set <key> <value>`.

- `disable1MContext` defaults to `false`. Enable with
  `bb plugin config provider-claude-code set disable1MContext true` to set
  `CLAUDE_CODE_DISABLE_1M_CONTEXT=1` (`0` when off). Changes restart the
  thread's Claude process before its next turn, preserving context.
- `chromeEnabled` defaults to `false`. It starts Claude Code with `--chrome` for
  Claude in Chrome tools. The host needs the extension and a claude.ai login.
  A change restarts the thread's Claude process before its next turn, preserving
  context.
- Select the Fast service tier in the model picker or pass `--service-tier fast`
  to `bb thread spawn` for supported Opus models. Use
  `bb thread tell --service-tier fast` to change a thread on its next turn;
  `default` turns it off. Fast mode requires eligible Claude access;
  subscription accounts need usage credits. It is billed at premium rates.
  The provider passes the selection as a session-scoped SDK setting, so it
  does not change the user's Claude defaults.
- `sandboxEnabled` defaults to `true`. In Accept Edits and Approve for me modes
  bb runs Claude Code's Bash commands in its sandbox. Set it to `false` to use
  Claude Code's own command approvals and sandbox settings instead. A change
  restarts the thread's Claude process before its next turn, preserving context.
- bb passes only `BB_CLAUDE_CODE_EXECUTABLE` and `CLAUDE_CODE_OAUTH_TOKEN` to
  the CLI. Mint the token with `claude setup-token` for machines with no
  interactive login.
- Sessions, model discovery, and maintenance share executable discovery:
  `BB_CLAUDE_CODE_EXECUTABLE`, then `PATH`, then known install locations.
  Unix fallbacks are `~/.local/bin/claude`, `~/.claude/local/claude`,
  `/opt/homebrew/bin/claude`, and `/usr/local/bin/claude`; Windows uses
  `%USERPROFILE%/.local/bin/claude.exe`. Root users only use explicit
  overrides or `PATH`. Invalid overrides never select another installation.
  Windows maintenance also recognizes npm command shims through `PATHEXT`;
  SDK sessions automatically select only `claude.exe`.
  A native install does not need to be on `PATH` to be detected. If Claude
  reports that required remote managed settings could not load, run
  `<executablePath> auth login` on the affected machine, using the path from
  `bb machine provider-cli status`. Reinstalling does not refresh its login.
- Structured plan, message editing, and compaction are supported through the
  corresponding `bb thread` commands. Unlisted model IDs are accepted by the
  provider; verify actual availability on the target host.

Inspect the thread and provider state after a change; do not restart unrelated
threads or change settings merely to answer a question.
